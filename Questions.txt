(1) helper.c, lines #345 and #350 - The pArray makes sense if ncl and nrl are 0. What is the point of the pArray when ncl and nrl are > 0? For example, when they are 2?
Note: I suggest we use ncl = nrl = 0 when allocating memory for all our data, atleast for this project.

    - The coordinate [ncl,nrl] refers to the top-left corner of the matrix (smallest point), while [nch,nrh] refers to the bottom-right corner.
      If you create a matrix with ncl = nrl = 2, and nch = nrh = 4, then you will get a 2x2 matrix, but if ncl = nrl = 0 you get a 4x4 matrix.
      I imagine the idea is that if you wanted to save a copy of just a small region of a grid this would let you specify just the existing grid
      indices for the region you want to capture without computing the actual size yourself, which could be a little more convenient.
